# Project-3-Testing

## Test Application Information
This testing app is the Selenium test written to test the [E-Commerce-Spring-Capstone](https://github.com/Jasdhir-JwA-Team3/e-commerce-spring-capstone) back-end and [E-Commerce-React-Capstone](https://github.com/Jasdhir-JwA-Team3/e-commerce-react-capstone) front-end integration. We also use postman to test API endpoints.

### Information on the application we are testing
There are 2 different types of users in the application, a customer and an administrator. Each user has a different level of access depending on whether they are a customer or not. For example customers can search for a product, create an account, log in, edit their profile, edit their orders, reset their password, change the website from dark to light mode. Admins on the site can create new products, set the price, image and title.

## Prerequisites / Additional Setup
There is some setup for the Front-End and the Back-End to work together and the STARTUP.MD is included in the [E-Commerce-Spring-Capstone](https://github.com/Jasdhir-JwA-Team3/e-commerce-spring-capstone) repository. This file goes through all the steps to get the 2 repositories working together
